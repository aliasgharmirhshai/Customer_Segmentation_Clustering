# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Overview

customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm, an unsupervised learning technique. 

## RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation

In this project, we use **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis as a data-driven approach to segment customers based on their purchase behavior:

- **Recency** – Measures how recently a customer made a purchase. Customers who purchased more recently are considered more engaged.
- **Frequency** – Captures how often a customer makes purchases. Higher frequency indicates customer loyalty.
- **Monetary Value** – Reflects how much a customer has spent. Higher values indicate more valuable customers.
